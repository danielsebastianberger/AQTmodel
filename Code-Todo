- Adversary Hierarchy
Adversaries are currently using different interfaces and not all have been ported to the most current development version.
These are adversary development stages:
1. Basic e.g. BaseballHalf
2. Subclassing from Advanced Adversary (AA)
3. Exporting as much functionality to AA as possible
4. Using different statistics reports

=> this means that some offer different interfaces to the omnet.ini configuration.
=> needs be resolved



- Simplify adversary definition
  - Paths are written down the wrong way.
  - Use ++ Syntax to add node to path
  - Advance on subclassing and reuse. Maybe we don't need a new module for each adversary?
